# Connect city code challenge

## Introduction

This service will give the the details about the connectivity between the two cities. Configured the connected cities in the cities.txt file and loads the data while starting of the application. This spring boot micro service also includes the below features

- SwaggerUI and REST documentation
- Junit parameterized test cases
- Code coverage with EclEmma
- Functional test cases (Possitive & Negative)
- Logging using logback
- Actuator metrics
- Exception handling
- Java documentation

## Technologies Used

- Java 8 (This will work with java 11 also. We need to modify the version in the pom.xml to point to 11 (_<java.version>11</java.version>_)).
- SpringBoot 2.4.x

If you are using java.version 11, then make sure java_home also should point to java 11 to build the project in the command prompt.

## Tools used

- Maven for build
- EclEmma for coverage
- STS 4.x for development
- Spotbugs plugin

## Test data

City1 | City2 
------------ | -------------
Boston |  New York
Philadelphia | Newark
Newark | Boston
Trenton | Albany
Newark | Allen Town
Philadelphia | Allen Town

## Implemented test cases and expected results
Origin | Destination | Connectivity
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Boston | Newark | yes
Boston | Philadelphia | yes
Boston | Phila%delphia | no
Philadelphia | Albany | no
Trenton | Albany | yes
Albany | Trenton | yes
Alb$any | Trenton | no
Trenton | Alb#any | no

## Junit test cases details

## Implementation steps:
- Prepare the data which hold complete connectivity details from each city and store it in the map where key is the city and value is the series of connected cities with direct connection and indirect connection at the time of bootstrap.
- This data is case insensitive means user can send the data in any case.
- If user requested for origin and destination city connectivity, then the connecitivity registry will pull the data from map and check the destination is there or not in the connected cities. If it present, then service will return yes else no.
- This service is expecting both origin and destination cities are mandatory. If anyone is not present, then application will not accept the data and respond with 400 status code with some error code details. So that consumer can correct the input data.
- Extensive junits are implemented to check service is responding properly or not.
- Predefined connectivity details are available in cities.txt file.

### Some sample requests
* Input -1 
```
http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=Boston&destination=Newark
```

```json
yes
```

* Input -2
```
http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=Boston&destination=Philadelphia
```

```json
yes
```

* Input -3 
```
http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=Philadelphia&destination=Albany
```

```json
No
```
### Some error responses
* Input -1 
```
http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=Boston&destination=
```
```json
{
  "errorMessage": "Origin city is required",
  "errorCode": "CITY001"
}
```

### How to run?
1. Download the code from github using below url
```
git clone https://github.com/sureshdharisi/codechallenge.git
```
2. Goto the project where pom.xml is located and run the maven command. The below command will run the junit test cases automatically
```
mvn clean install
```
3. Run the application using spring boot plugin.
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Swagger UI
```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```
### Swagger YAML
````
http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs
````
### Actuator URL
````
http://localhost:8080/actuator/
````
### Generate spotbug report
1. Run below command to generate spot bug report
````
mvn site
````
Now report will be generated in the target folder and the location is "find-city-connect\target\site\spotbugs.html"
